# Block Unblock Card

The Service will then determine the type of request, block or unblock a card. The block code passed on the input message will be subject to a priority check against the block code priority definition on the Block Code Matrix. No block code priority check will occur when an unblock request is processed. 
The Service will update the block code field on the payment instrument id with the associated block code date using the next processing date from the accountâ€™s business unit.
