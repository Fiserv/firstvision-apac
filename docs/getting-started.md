# Welcome to FirstVisionâ„¢ RESTful Web Services

The FirstVision-APAC APIs are built on the foundation of REST. The APIs accept standard JSON requests and return JSON encoded responses while leveraging industry standard [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for a seamless integration. Interaction through our APIs provides the developer community the ability to retrieve/update the customer demographic information, account's financial information,and, the payment instrument details in a simple and intuitive manner. It also provides APIs to retrieve transactions, statements details, loyalty points, offers, and, multiple EMIs conversion details.
