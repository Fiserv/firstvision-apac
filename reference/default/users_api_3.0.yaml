            entity will use to sign on to the system. The sign-on name can consist
            of letters (A–Z), numbers (0–9), and embedded spaces, but not a leading
            space. When adding a new Sign-on entity, the sign-on name must be a unique
            name not already assigned to any existing User Security Sign-on entity
            for your institution (client ID).

            to be added and assigned a future activation date so that the entiry is
            automatically active on that future date, The format is MM/DD/YYYY or

            this field to zero. When this field is zero, signon attempts fail and
            are reported on the Security Violations Report (T130). This date must
            be changed to a valid future expiration date to enable the Sign-on entity
            to be used for signing on again, The format is MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY
