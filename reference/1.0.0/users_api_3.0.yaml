            name not already assigned to any existing User Security Sign-on entity
            for your institution (client ID).

            are reported on the Security Violations Report (T130). This date must
            be changed to a valid future expiration date to enable the Sign-on entity
            to be used for signing on again, The format is MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY
